Description:
 
These makefile options should work on generic Pentium/Linux
machines with these compilers:

PGI   f90 4.1 http://www.pgroup.com/ TESTED
Intel ifc 7.1 http://www.intel.com/  TESTED

It is in the project list the possibility to include absoft f90
and eventually the first full working version of any free
fortran 90/95.

This is actually my test environment.
