  odds

  COPYING is the copyright notice file.

  ./others at present contains a local copy of the BLAS and LAPACK
  routines to guarantee portability.

  Machines specific tasks should have been already accouted for in
  the Make.XXX files in each ./config/m_ARCH_OS directory.
  These files account for the compilers options and set the relative
  -DXXX (define) variable for the compilation.
  At present the only machine dependent code is found in
  ./includes/pcmdline.F90 which adds command line capabilities
  to fortran 90 programs. If your machine/compiler combination
  doesn't support command line capabilities you should modify this
  file and eventually introduce a wrapper.
