# Copyright notice
Please note that some code lines might be a copy of other sources,
usually free source code, as this project started many years ago.

Minuit in particular, I started from an original F77 (free) code
and translated into F90. I contacted CERN (current minuit copyright holder) for a confirmation.

# Intro

I want to revive an old project. It is a fortran framework. It uses very
standard shell scripts and other tools like perl, awk, sed etc.

The target are molecules, the name actually changed from frimol to freemol.
Was FRIbourg MOLecules now it is FREE (beer) MOLecules.

The framework is at ./Freemol
