freemol 2003

# Intro

I want to revive an old project. At present I start with some "stubs" routines.

The target are molecules, the name actually changed from frimol to freemol. Was FRIbourg MOLecules now it is FREE (beer) MOLecules.

# Copyright notice
Please note that some code lines might be a copy of other sources. Free source code, including minuit. As I just started I might have missed the reference (if it exists anymore). I will do an effort to update the relative documentation.

Minuit in particular, I started from an original F77 (free) code and translated into F90. I contacted CERN for a confirmation.
