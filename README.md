# Copyright notice
Please note that some code lines might be a copy of other sources,
usually free source code, as this project started many years ago.

Minuit in particular, I started from an original F77 (free) code
and translated into F90. I contacted CERN (current minuit copyright holder) for a confirmation.

# Intro

The framework is at ./Freemol

# Programs

## adfrom
   A code to work with ADF (Amsterdam Density Functional)
   
## ch4sym2cart
   Convert coordinates from symmetric to cartesian for CH4 (Methane) like molecules

## CSMG
   Compute the CSM "Continuous Symmetry Measure" of weighted point objects using gaussians
   functions as weight and pure spacial overlap/superposition.

## fit1Dpol
   Fit about anything in 1 dimension. Anything might mean you need to add your functions,
   but it has a nice polynomial setup.
   It has nice features to work with multi-columns ASCII files.
   You can script which data to fit with ranged commands like
   copy, add, sub, shift, scale etc..

## Freemol
   Just a placeholder at present

## XY4Coord
   Coordinates transformation

## XY4PolySphere
   Coordinates transformation, the polyspherical version
